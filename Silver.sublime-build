/*
  Description of JSON-keys semantics in this file
  -----------------------------------------------

  "target"
  --------
  Use custom build commands execution script. The commands are essentially
  python classes saved in the BuildSilver.py script. The command class
  SilverBuildCommand has "silver_build" as the corresponding JSON-value.

  "cmd"
  -----
  The default build command. Value is a list of command line arguments,
  starting with the absolute path to the command.

  "variants"
  ----------
  Alternative building variants. Contain at least two elements:
  1. "name": "Current build variant name"
  2. "cmd" with the same structure as for the default "cmd".

  "working_dir"
  -------------
  Set the working directory to the directory of the Silver file we are
  working on. If we run Silicon on an input file and it reports errors
  together with the input file name but not the path to the latter, then
  the "Next/Previous Result" navigation (as well as clicking on the reported
  errors) will only work if the input can be found in the current working
  directory.

  "selector"
  ----------
  An optional string used to locate the best builder to use for the current
  file scope. This is only relevant if Tools/Build System/Automatic is true.

  "file_regex"
  ------------
  file_regex is used to find the line, column and message. If it matches,
  each line above the match (starting from the line directly above the match)
  is matched against file_regex in order to find the file name.

  "line_regex"
  ------------
  Optional. If the file_regex doesn’t match on the current line, but there’s
  a line_regex specified, and it does match the current line, then walk
  backwards through the buffer until a line matching the file regex is found:
  use these two matches to determine the file and line to go to.

  "syntax"
  --------
  Optional. If provided, it will be used to colorize the build system’s output.

  "error_file"
  ------------
  Tell run_silicon where it can find the file to which the verification
  errors have been written.
